# Triage tool

`jax-toolbox-triage` is a tool to automate the process of attributing regressions to an
individual commit of JAX or XLA.
It takes as input a command that returns an error (non-zero) code when run in "recent"
containers, but which returns a success (zero) code when run in some "older" container.
The command must be executable within the containers, *i.e.* it cannot refer to files
that only exist on the host system.

The tool follows a three-step process:
  1. A container-level search backwards from the "recent" container where the test is
     known to fail, which identifies an "older" container where the test passes. This
     search proceeds with an exponentially increasing step size and is based on the
     `YYYY-MM-DD` tags under `ghcr.io/nvidia/jax`.
  2. A container-level binary search to refine this to the **latest** available
     container where test passes and the **earliest** available container where it
     fails.
  3. A commit-level binary search, repeatedly building + testing inside the same
     container, to identify a single commit of JAX (XLA) that causes the test to start
     failing, and a reference commit of XLA (JAX) that can be used to reproduce the
     regression.

The third step can also be used on its own, via the `--passing-container` and
`--failing-container` options, which allows it to be used between private container
tags, without the dependency on the `ghcr.io/nvidia/jax` registry. This assumes that
the given containers are closely related to those from JAX-Toolbox
(`ghcr.io/nvidia/jax:XXX`):
* JAX and XLA sources at `/opt/{jax,xla}[-source]`
* `build-jax.sh` script from JAX-Toolbox available in the container

## Installation

The triage tool can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox.git#subdirectory=.github/triage
```
or directly from a checkout of the JAX-Toolbox repository.

You should make sure `pip` is up to date, for example with `pip install -U pip`. The
versions of `pip` installed on cluster head/compute nodes can be quite old. The
recommended installation method, using `virtualenv`, should take care of this for you.

Because the tool needs to orchestrate running commands in multiple containers, it is
most convenient to install it in a virtual environment on the host system, rather than
attempting to install it inside a container.

The recommended installation method is to install `virtualenv` natively on the host
system, and then use that to create an isolated environment on the host system for the
triage tool, *i.e.*:
```bash
virtualenv triage-venv
./triage-venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox.git#subdirectory=.github/triage
./triage-venv/bin/jax-toolbox-triage ...
```

The tool should be invoked on a machine with `docker` available and whatever GPUs are
needed to execute the test case.

## Usage

To use the tool, there are two compulsory inputs:
   * A test command to triage.
   * A specification of which containers to triage in. There are two choices here:
     * `--container`: which of the `ghcr.io/nvidia/jax:CONTAINER-YYYY-MM-DD` container
       families to execute the test command in. Example: `jax` for a JAX unit test
       failure, `maxtext` for a MaxText model execution failure. The `--start-date` and
       `--end-date` options can be combined with `--container` to tune the search; see
       below for more details.
     * `--passing-container` and `--failing-container`: a pair of URLs to containers to
       use in the commit-level search; if these are passed then no container-level
       search is performed.

The test command will be executed directly in the container, not inside a shell, so be
sure not to add excessive quotation marks (*i.e.* run
`jax-toolbox-triage --container=jax test-jax.sh foo` not
`jax-toolbox-triage --container=jax "test-jax.sh foo"`), and you should aim to make it
as fast and targeted as possible.

If you want to run multiple commands, you might want to use something like
`jax-toolbox-triage --container=jax sh -c "command1 && command2"`.

The expectation is that the test case will be executed successfully several times as
part of the triage, so you may want to tune some parameters to reduce the execution
time in the successful case.
For example, if `text-maxtext.sh --steps=500 ...` is failing on step 0, you should
probably reduce `--steps` to optimise execution time in the successful case.

A JSON status file and both info-level and debug-level logfiles are written to the
directory given by `--output-prefix`.
Info-level output is also written to the console, and includes the path to the debug
log file.

You should pay attention to the first execution of your test case, to make sure it is
failing for the correct reason. For example:
```console
$ jax-toolbox-triage --container jax command-you-forgot-to-install
```
will not immediately abort, because the tool is **expecting** the command to fail in
the early stages of the triage:
```

```
where, notably, the triage search is continuing.

### Optimising container-level search performance

By default, the container-level search starts from the most recent available container,
if you already know that the test has been failing for a while, you can pass
`--end-date` to start the search further in the past.
If you are sure that the test is failing on the `--end-date` you have passed, you can
skip verification of that fact by passing `--skip-precondition-checks` (but see below
for other checks that this skips).

By default, the container-level backwards search for a date on which the test passed
tries the containers approximately [1, 2, 4, ...] days before `--end-date`.
This can be tuned by passing `--start-date`, which overrides the "end date minus one"
start value (but leaves the exponential growth of the search range width).
If you are sure that the test is passing on the `--start-date` you have passed, you can
skip verification of that fact by passing `--skip-precondition-checks`.

The combination of `--start-date`, `--end-date` and `--skip-precondition-checks` can be
used to skip the entire first stage of the bisection process.

The second stage of the triage process can be made to abort early using the
`--threshold-days` option; this stage will terminate once the delta between the latest
known-good and earliest known-bad containers is below the threshold.

If you need to re-start the tool for some reason, use of these options can help
bootstrap the tool using the results of a previous (partial) run.

### Optimising commit-level search performance

The third stage of the triage process involves repeatedly building JAX and XLA, which
can be sped up significantly using a Bazel cache.
By default, a local directory on the host machine (where the tool is being executed)
will be used, but it may be more efficient to use a persistent and/or pre-heated cache.
This can be achieved by passing the `--bazel-cache` option, which accepts absolute
paths and `http`/`https`/`grpc` URLs.

If `--skip-precondition-checks` is passed, a sanity check that the failure can be
reproduced after rebuilding the JAX/XLA commits from the first-known-bad container
inside that container will be skipped. 

## Example

Here is an example execution for a JAX unit test failure, with some annotation:
```console
user@gpu-machine $ jax-toolbox-triage --container jax test-jax.sh //tests:nn_test_gpu
```
`--end-date` was not passed, and 2024-10-15 is the most recent available container
at the time of execution
```
[INFO] 2024-10-16 00:31:41 Checking end-of-range failure in 2024-10-15
```
`--skip-precondition-checks` was not passed, so the tool checks that the test does, in
fact, fail in the 2024-10-15 container
```
[INFO] 2024-10-16 00:33:36 Ran test case in 2024-10-15 in 114.8s, pass=False
```
`--start-date` was not passed, so the first (backwards search) stage of the triage
process starts with the container 1 day before the end of the range, *i.e.* 2024-10-14
```
[INFO] 2024-10-16 00:33:37 Starting coarse search with 2024-10-14 based on end_date=2024-10-15

This failure is fixed in [jax#24427](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/pull/24427).

## Limitations

This tool aims to target the common case that regressions are due to commits in JAX or
XLA, so if the root cause is different it may not converge, although the partial results
may still be helpful.

For example, if the regression is due to a new version of some other dependency
`SomeProject` that was first installed in the `2024-10-15` container, then the first
two stages of the triage process will correctly identify that `2024-10-15` is the
critical date, but the third stage will fail because it will try and fail to reproduce
test success by building the JAX/XLA commits from `2024-10-14` in the `2024-10-15`
container.

Other limitations include that only `docker` is supported as a container runtime, which
also implies that it is not currently possible to triage a test that requires a
multi-node or multi-process test.

The tool also does not currently handle skipping commits that do not compile, or test
cases that require copying files (*e.g.* script files) into the container.

If you run into these limitations in real-world usage of this tool, please file a bug
against JAX-Toolbox including details of manual steps you took to root-case the test
regression.
