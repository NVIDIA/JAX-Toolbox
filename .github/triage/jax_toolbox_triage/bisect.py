    Get the commit history for a given package between two commits.

    Args:
        worker (Container): The container worker to execute commands.
        package (str): The name of the package.
        start (str): The starting commit hash.
        end (str): The ending commit hash.
        dir (str): The directory where the git repository is located.
        main_branch (str): The main branch name. Defaults is the default branch of the repo.
        logger (Logger, optional): Logger for debug information. Defaults to None.
        args: Additional arguments that may contain cherry-pick commits.

    Returns:
